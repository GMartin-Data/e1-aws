    Define a basic AWS Lambda function handler.

    This function is the entry point for Lambda invocations.
    It logs the incoming event and returns a simple success response.

    Args:
        event (dict): The event data that triggered the Lambda function.
                      For S3 triggers, this dict will contain details about
                      the uploaded object (e.g., bucket name, object key).
        context (object): The Lambda runtime context object. Provides
                          information about the invocation, function, and environment.

    Returns:
        dict: A response dictionary, typically containing 'statusCode' and 'body'.
